# Automatic Recipe Generator

The Automatic Recipe Generator is a project that allows users to generate a recipe based on the ingredients they have available at home or the ingredients they want to use. This project was built using OpenAI's GPT-3 API and DALL-E 2, and can be run in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Getting Started

To use the Automatic Recipe Generator, you will need to have a Jupyter Notebook environment set up on your machine. You will also need to have an API key from OpenAI to use their GPT-3 API.

Once you have these prerequisites, you can download the project code from this GitHub repository and open the `Recipe_Generator.ipynb` file in your Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Usage

To use the Automatic Recipe Generator, follow these steps:

```
1. Start by providing a list of ingredients you have available or want to use in the    provided cell.

2. Run the cell to generate a recipe title, instructions, and a DALL-E 2 image of the finished dish based on your input.

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions to make the recipe at home.
  
```
